      All of the information we collected was used to create personas.
    </p>
    <p>
      We created 3 personas to simply categorize 90%+ of our users. Based
      on our research we applied appropriate quantitative and qualitative
      metrics to each group. These 3 Personas (Student, International
      Student, and Faculty/Staff), were heavily relied upon during the
      design and prototyping phases.
