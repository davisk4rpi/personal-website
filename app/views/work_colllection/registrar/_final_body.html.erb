      As the lead developer for the project, I used HTLM/CSS and Bootstrap
      to create our final project deliverable. I created enough of the
      website to perform testing for our main use cases and to act as a
      template for the completion of the website.

      Some key improvements from the original site are: Designed a more
      aesthetically pleasing interface; Reduced the top level navigation to
      eliminate information overload; Use of actionable and simple language
      to avoid confusion due to misunderstanding of terminology;
      Highlighted the mostimportant tasks for each user in their respective
      "How Do I" sections.

      <em>*Since the prototype is limited, I suggest pretending that you are a student
      looking for their Dean's Letter or an instructor trying to change a student's
      grade. According to Google Analytics and our surveys, these were the most
      common user needs.</em>
