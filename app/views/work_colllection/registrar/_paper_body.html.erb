      With the bulk of our research completed, we hosted a card sorting
      exercise and designed our site's architecture. After we drafted the
      general architecture, we sketched dozens of potential designs. From
      those sketches we extracted the best parts and created a few paper
      prototypes. These low fidelity prototypes were field tested and we
      were ready to move on to our first digital prototype.
