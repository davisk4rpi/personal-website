    This very website was built using Rails, at least partly. Granted, this site
    is almost entirely static. It was far easier to piece together my
    work with Rails than otherwise. It also gives me lots of flexibility for future
    features. Not to mention how easy it was to deploy on
    <%= link_to "Heroku", "https://www.heroku.com/" %>.

    The bulk of this site uses Bootstrap for its styling.
