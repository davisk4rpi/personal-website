  <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
  <p>
    A highly technical and business-minded innovator with a hybrid background
    in aerospace manufacturing and web development. I am known for providing
    simple solutions to complex problems and elevating the performance of others.
    My projects have ranged from designing 3D printed equipment modifications to
    machining carbon fiber to building this website.

    <strong>Send me a message</strong>:<br>I am currently looking for a role as a Full-Stack Web Developer or Product
    Manager. I am also open to slight deviations from these roles. Please,
    explore my portfolio and resume and reach out if you think that I would be
    a good fit at your company.

    I am presently employed in multi-functional role by Boeing Research &
    Technology. We design and develop cutting edge manufacturing technology for
    composite materials. I am formally educated in Mechanical & Materials
    Engineering, Economics, and User-Centered Design. This has contributed to
    my diverse skills set but I am still constantly expanding my repertoire.
