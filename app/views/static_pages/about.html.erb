      <strong>Send me a message</strong>:<br>I am currently looking for a role as
      a Full-Stack Web Developer or Product Manager. I am also open to slight
      deviations from these roles. Please, explore my portfolio/resume and
      reach out if you think that I would be a good fit at your company.
      Alternatively, send me a message if you just want to talk about my work or
      yours. I am always interested in conversation about technology.

      I am presently employed in a multi-functional role by Boeing Research &
      Technology. We design and develop cutting edge manufacturing technology for
      composite materials. I am formally educated in Mechanical & Materials
      Engineering, Economics, and User-Centered Design. I am a self taught
      full-stack web developer. These have all contributed to my diverse
      skillset but I am still constantly expanding my repertoire.
